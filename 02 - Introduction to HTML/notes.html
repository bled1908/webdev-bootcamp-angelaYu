HTML - HyperText Transfer Protocol
HyperText - Such text which leads us to another page
Markup Language - Editing the texts like underlining them, making them bold, et.

a website essentially needs HTML file, without it, website can't be made.

<h1>Hello World</h1>
here <h1>, </h1> these  are tags, opening and closing tags respectively, the above whole sentence is an element and 'Hello World' is content.

Headings:
<h1>Heading 1</h1>
<h2>Heading 2</h2>
<h3>Heading 3</h3>
<h4>Heading 4</h4>
<h5>Heading 5</h5>
<h6>Heading 89</h6>

It's not good practice to have more than one <h1> tag in a single page.

Don't skip a level when you are creating headings, like don't go from <h1> to <h3> directly.

<p></p> - paragraph tag

void elements - elements that don't have closing tags, like <img> tag
<hr /> - horizontal rule tag, it creates a horizontal line
<p>This is a paragraph</p>
<hr />
<p>This is another paragraph</p>
<br /> - line break tag, it creates a line break
<p>Lorem, ipsum dolor sit amet consectetur adipisicing elit. cdc<br /> Illum aspernatur nam totam ipsa quasi at vitae consectetur, labore deleniti corrupti.</p>

<p>To see a World in a Grain of Sand<br />
And a Heaven in a Wild Flower<br />
Hold Infinity in the palm of your hand<br />
And Eternity in an hour.<br /></p>

Make every paragraph with separate <p> tag, don't use <br /> tag to separate paragraphs. <br /> tag is used to separate lines within a paragraph. It is done for code readability.
